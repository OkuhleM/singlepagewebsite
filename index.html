      <h1>Greek mythology </h1>
      <p>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks,<br> and a genre of Ancient Greek
        folklore. These
        stories concern the origin and <br>nature of the world,the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and
        mythological<br>
        creatures, and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and<br> ritual practices. Modern
        scholars study
        the myths to shed light on the religious<br> and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better
        understand the
        nature <br>of myth-making itself.</p>
