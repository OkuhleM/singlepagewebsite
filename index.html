      <h1>Greek mythology </h1>
      <p>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks,<br> and a genre of Ancient Greek
        folklore. These
        stories concern the origin and nature of the world, <br>the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and
        mythological
        creatures, and the origins and significance of the <br>ancient Greeks' own cult and ritual practices. Modern
        scholars study
        the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, <br>and to better
        understand the
        nature of myth-making itself.</p>

        became the God of the underworld. </p>
